        # The "app" cache stores to the filesystem by default.
        # The data in this cache should persist between deploys.

        # Redis
        app: cache.adapter.redis
        # default_redis_provider: redis://localhost
        default_redis_provider: '%env(resolve:CACHE_URL)%'
        # I'm running an instance of Redis inside a Docker container, and I've created an entry in my hosts file
        # that will point the redis domain at 127.0.0.1. The port 6379 will probably be the same for you,
        # as this is the default, but you'll need to alter the rest of the url to meet your own needs.
        # e.g. redis://<your url here>:6379

        # APCu (not recommended with heavy random-write workloads as memory fragmentation can cause perf issues)
        #app: cache.adapter.apcu

        # Namespaced pools use the above "app" backend by default
        #pools:
            #my.dedicated.cache: null
